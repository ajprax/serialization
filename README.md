serialization
=============

A serialization library

This library is far from ready for use, but...

To use, depend on:
 * "org.ajprax:ajprax-serialization-api:x.y.z" in compile scope.
 * "org.ajprax:ajprax-serialization-impl:x.y.z" in runtime scope.

All classes in *.impl packages are private and subject to change without warning. For now, everything in all packages is subject to change without warning.
